# Intro

Hi, I’m Matthias Rudolph.

I’m a computer science student (final year) with a master's degree in philosophy, with a love for problem solving. I combine the technological knowledge of computer science with the analytical approach of the humanities.

I'm interested in software engineering, and information and network security.
